Hey! heres a simple pomodoro timer project to get you started on the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS! 
I followed a tutorial from https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-pomodoro-app-with-html-css-js which goes over how to set up the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in full detail!
I added a few other things in here to make the project a little more fleshed out. That being the pause and reset button on the timer! 
Happy coding!
