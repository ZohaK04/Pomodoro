Hey! heres a simple pomodoro timer project to get you started on the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS! 
I followed a tutorial from https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-pomodoro-app-with-html-css-js which goes over everything you need to know in full detail!
I added a few other things in here to make the project a little more fleshed out. That being the pause and reset button on the timer! 

UPDATE: I also wanted to add a few personal touches to make this more personal so i added background music hehe :D
Happy coding!
